# Results and Findings

## Model Performance

Our machine learning models achieved significant predictive power in identifying neighborhoods likely to experience gentrification. The Random Forest model proved particularly effective with an accuracy of over 80% in identifying changing neighborhoods.

## Key Indicators

The most significant predictors of neighborhood change were:

1. **Housing Cost to Income Ratio**: Areas with increasing housing costs relative to income
2. **Educational Attainment**: Neighborhoods with rising proportion of residents with higher education
3. **Age Demographics**: Areas with growing younger professional populations
4. **Transport Accessibility**: Proximity to public transportation

## Spatial Patterns

Our analysis revealed clear spatial patterns in gentrification risk:

- **Cluster Effect**: Gentrification tends to spread outward from already gentrified areas
- **Transport Influence**: Areas near new or improved transport links showed higher probability of change
- **Border Zones**: Neighborhoods at the boundaries between affluent and less affluent areas showed high susceptibility

## Policy Implications

These findings have several implications for urban policy:

- Potential to identify at-risk neighborhoods before significant displacement occurs
- Opportunity to implement preemptive housing affordability measures
- Framework for evaluating the impact of infrastructure investments on neighborhood change
