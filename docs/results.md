# Results and Findings

## Model Performance

Our machine learning models achieved significant predictive power in identifying neighborhoods likely to experience gentrification. The Random Forest model proved particularly effective with an accuracy of over 80% in identifying changing neighborhoods.

## Key Indicators

The most significant predictors of neighborhood change were:

1. **Housing Cost to Income Ratio**: Areas with increasing housing costs relative to income
2. **Educational Attainment**: Neighborhoods with rising proportion of residents with higher education
3. **Age Demographics**: Areas with growing younger professional populations
4. **Transport Accessibility**: Proximity to public transportation

## Spatial Patterns

Our analysis revealed clear spatial patterns in gentrification risk:

- **Cluster Effect**: Gentrification tends to spread outward from already gentrified areas
- **Transport Influence**: Areas near new or improved transport links showed higher probability of change
- **Border Zones**: Neighborhoods at the boundaries between affluent and less affluent areas showed high susceptibility

## Policy Implications

These findings have several implications for urban policy:

- Potential to identify at-risk neighborhoods before significant displacement occurs
- Opportunity to implement preemptive housing affordability measures
- Framework for evaluating the impact of infrastructure investments on neighborhood change

## Interactive Maps

While not displayed directly on this page, the project includes code for generating interactive maps of predicted gentrification risk. These visualizations can be created by running the provided notebooks with your own data.
