# Predicting Neighbourhood Change with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project supports replication and exploration of the analysis undertaken for the [Urban Studies](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/usj) article ["Understanding urban gentrification through Machine Learning: Predicting neighbourhood change in London"](https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098018789054).

The research uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict gentrification patterns in urban neighborhoods. The analysis combines census data, socio-economic scoring, and predictive modeling to identify areas likely to undergo significant demographic change.

## Getting Started

The project is set up to run in a controlled Python environment using Anaconda. For installation instructions and more details, please see the [full README](https://github.com/KristoferKwan/urb-studies-predicting-gentrification/blob/main/README.md).

## Results

Our machine learning approach successfully identifies patterns of neighborhood change and gentrification risk across urban areas. The methodology demonstrates how computational techniques can provide insights for urban planning and policy development.
